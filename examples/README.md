# Here are examples

 * the py files : are the python custom elements ...
 * the js files : are the rendered javascript versions (by *wyc*'s pytests)
 * the html files : are the showcases ;-)

See [many](many.html) : which show many Custom elements, from simplest to more complex ones

See [wcsplyt](wcsplyt.html) : for a useful real component ("wc-splyt" (similar to [wc-split](https://github.com/Giwi/wc-split))) ;-)


BTW, if you use *wyc*, and you build a useful component : let's share with me/us, and I will add it in that repo ...
